As you follow through the navigation bar, we have a Home page (that you are currently on), a Shop page that contains 'New Additions', 'Succulents', 'Ferns', 'Plant Care' and our 'Entire Collection', next we have a Gardening Tips page followed by a About Us page and Contact page. The shopping cart can also be seen through your entire journey of the store.

When you scroll down on the Home page, you will see our lookbook with buttons to view our different product sections. You can click on any one of them to go to a specific page. The lookbook automatically slides through our sections but you can also click on the left or right arrows (marked in red) to skip through the sections.
Another alternative is to click on the Shop page in the navigation bar to see our different products in a dropdown.
